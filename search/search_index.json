Officially, the repository is in beta \u2014 the project is adding workflows as they are developed and put into production. \ud83c\udfe0 Homepage Getting Started At the time of writing, all workflows are written in WDL and are tested using Cromwell . We use Oliver to easily interact with the Cromwell server to perform various tasks. Although we do not test outside of Cromwell, we expect that the workflows will work just as well using other runners. The easiest way to get started is to install bioconda and the run the following commands: conda create -n workflows-dev -c conda-forge cromwell==47 -y conda activate workflows-dev git clone git@github.com:stjudecloud/workflows.git cd workflows Any of the workflows in the workflows folder is a good place to start, e.g. cromwell run workflows/reference/bootstrap-reference.wdl --inputs workflows/reference/inputs.json Repository Structure The repository is laid out as follows: conf - Cromwell configuration files created for various environments that we use across our team. Feel free to use/fork/suggest improvements. docker - Dockerfiles used in our workflows. All docker images are published to Docker Hub . At the time of writing, there is only one Docker image heavily in use, which is our bioinformatics base image . tools - All tools we have wrapped as individual WDL tasks. workflows - Directory containing all end-to-end bioinformatics workflows. Workflows Available The current workflows exist in this repo with the following statuses: Name Version Description Specification Workflow Status Build References v2.0.0 (beta) Build reference files used in harmonization pipelines. None Workflow Standard RNA-Seq v2.0.0 (beta) Standard RNA-Seq harmonization pipeline. Specification Workflow Author \ud83d\udc64 St. Jude Cloud Team Website: https://stjude.cloud Github: @stjudecloud Twitter: @StJudeResearch Tests Given that this repo is still new, there are no tests. When we add tests, we will update the README. \ud83e\udd1d Contributing Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome! Feel free to check issues page . You can also take a look at the contributing guide . Versioning When versioned, workflows will be versioned according to the SemVer guidelines. For now, we do not guarantee that all workflows will have an associated version. \ud83d\udcdd License Copyright \u00a9 2019 St. Jude Cloud Team .
